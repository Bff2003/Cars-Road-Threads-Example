> The aim of this project is to demonstrate the use of threads and some of the precautions to be taken with practical everyday examples. 

The idea consists of multiple cars that leave from x point to arrive at y point, both have the same number of gasoline and are the same models of cars, however everyone goes at their own speed, but everyone in the middle of the race has to go to get gasoline, each person gets gasoline at a different speed, then the others will have to wait until they fill up their car tank.
